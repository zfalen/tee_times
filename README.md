*Truck Yeah* is a mobile-responsive web application designed to connect food truck owners with hungry customers. 

Trucks are entered into a central database, along with information regarding their operating hours, common locations and details on the food they serve.

*Truck Yeah* automatically generates truck profiles based upon this information, and serves it up to customers by category - i.e., 'Open Now,' 'Lunch,' or 'Dinner.'

The *Truck Yeah* stack is composed of (back-to-front):
- MongoDB
- Node / Express
- ReactJS (JSX)
- Limited EJS
- Webpack (browser compiling)

Also notable are the inclusion of:
- Passport (user authentication)
- Google Maps Javascript API
